The Task List is a good example of interactivity that can be used in online shopping carts or list managers. It has several options for adding, editing, deleting, and managing your tasks.

Behind the app: React.js, Ant UI, and cookie management to store tasks locally.

A demo of this app is available at <https://bpm-react-todo.herokuapp.com/>.
