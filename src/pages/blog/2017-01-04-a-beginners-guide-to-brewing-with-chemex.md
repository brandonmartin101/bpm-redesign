This site was built for Kalie Martin, a local voice teacher and opera performer in the Fox Valley area of Wisconsin. The site was custom-built since there is no ongoing content need, and the main priority of the site is to be fast and simple.

The live site is available here: <https://www.kaliemartinvoicestudio.com>
